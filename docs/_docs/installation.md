Prophet has two implementations: [R](#installation-in-r) and [Python](#installation-in-python).  Note the slight name difference for the Python package.

## Installation in R

Prophet is a [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=prophet) so you can use `install.packages`:

```
# R
> install.packages('prophet')
```

After installation, you can [get started!](quick_start.html#r-api)

### Windows

On Windows, R requires a compiler so you'll need to [follow the instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-on-Windows) provided by `rstan`.  The key step is installing [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) before attempting to install the package.

If you have custom Stan compiler settings, install from source rather than the CRAN binary.

## Installation in Python

Prophet is on PyPI, so you can use pip to install it:

```
# bash
$ pip install fbprophet
```

The major dependency that Prophet has is `pystan`.   PyStan has its own [installation instructions](http://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_beginner.html).

After installation, you can [get started!](quick_start.html#python-api)

### Windows

On Windows, PyStan requires a compiler so you'll need to [follow the instructions](http://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/windows.html).  The key step is installing a recent [C++ compiler](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools).

### Linux

Make sure compilers (gcc, g++) and Python development tools (python-dev) are installed. If you are using a VM, be aware that you will need at least 4GB of memory to install fbprophet, and at least 2GB of memory to use fbprophet.

### Anaconda

Use `conda install gcc` to set up gcc. The easiest way to install Prophet is through conda-forge: `conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet`.
